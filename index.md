          The artifact I selected is the Rescue Animal project, originally developed in an earlier course as a set of Java files for managing animal data. The initial version relied entirely on in-memory lists to store records, which limited scalability and data persistence.

  <h2>Narrative</h2>

  <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
  <p>The original artifact for this enhancement was the Rescue Animal Management System, a set of Java files created in the IT-145 course. It handled basic data entry and display for rescue animals but lacked persistent data storage, a user interface, and a scalable design. For my ePortfolio, I enhanced this project into a professional full-stack web application with a Java backend, Angular frontend, and MongoDB database.</p>

  <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
  <p>I selected this artifact because it best represents my overall growth as a software developer. Enhancing it allowed me to demonstrate full-stack integration, modular architecture, data validation, and algorithmic efficiency. The project evolved from a simple command-line tool into an organized, user-friendly system with structured data handling and validation, reflecting my ability to design scalable and maintainable applications.</p>

  <h3>Enhancement Reflections</h3>

  <h4>Software Design & Architecture</h4>
  <p>This enhancement focused on transforming the original linear Java code into a modular architecture. I created separate backend services and Angular components that improved readability, maintainability, and scalability. The process reinforced the importance of separation of concerns and structured file organization.</p>

  <h4>Algorithms & Data Structures</h4>
  <p>I implemented client-side sorting and filtering algorithms for displaying rescue animal data. These enhancements improved efficiency and user interaction by reducing backend load while ensuring data consistency. This process strengthened my understanding of how algorithmic principles apply to real-world interfaces and performance optimization.</p>

  <h4>Database Design & Integration</h4>
  <p>The most impactful enhancement was integrating MongoDB to replace in-memory data lists with persistent collections. Each record was structured and validated before insertion, supporting full CRUD functionality. This development helped me learn modern database design, connection handling, and backend data management in a full-stack environment.</p>

  <p>Through this enhancement process, I learned to merge front-end usability with backend structure and database persistence. The challenges—especially connecting Angular to Java and MongoDB—developed my problem-solving skills and solidified my confidence as a full-stack developer.</p>

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <p>
    Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on my technical growth and professional development. Throughout the program, I built a strong foundation in software engineering, data structures and algorithms, databases, and security. This ePortfolio highlights that growth through the enhancement of a single core artifact, the Rescue Animal project, which evolved from a simple Java console program into a full-stack web application built with Java Spring Boot, Angular, and MongoDB.
  </p>

  <p>
    This transformation showcases my ability to apply modern software engineering principles and demonstrates how I can design scalable, maintainable systems. The enhanced project introduced modular design, database integration, and client-side interaction through structured input validation and persistent data management. These updates reflect my ability to design efficient data structures, apply algorithmic problem-solving, and integrate technologies into a cohesive solution that meets professional standards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although most of my work was individual, I gained valuable experience using Git and GitHub, where I practiced version control, branching strategies, and clear commit documentation. I also learned about Scrum methodology and the importance of teamwork within an agile development environment. Understanding how roles such as product owner, scrum master, and developers collaborate to plan, prioritize, and deliver software helped me better structure my own workflow and appreciate how communication, organization, and translating user needs into technical requirements are critical in professional software development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creating this ePortfolio helped me showcase not only my technical skills but also my ability to document, organize, and present my work professionally. The Rescue Animal artifact serves as the centerpiece, representing how I can take an existing system and enhance it using modern technologies, good design principles, and efficient data handling. Together, these experiences have prepared me to enter the computer science field with confidence in my ability to deliver effective, maintainable, and scalable solutions that meet real-world needs.
